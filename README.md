# Abstract

<b>Background</b>

Previous models have estimated the total population attributable fraction of NG/CT on HIV incidence among men who have sex with men (MSM), but this does not represent realistic intervention effects. We estimated the potential impact of screening for NG/CT on downstream incidence of HIV among MSM.

<b>Methods </b>

Using a network model, we estimated the effects of varying coverage levels for STI screening among different priority populations: all sexually active MSM regardless of HIV serostatus, MSM with multiple recent (past 6 months) sex partners regardless of serostatus, MSM without HIV, and MSM with HIV. Under the assumption that all screening events included a urethral test, we also examined the effect of increasing of the proportion of screening events that include rectal screening for NG/CT on HIV incidence. 

<b>Results</b>

Increasing annual NG/CT screening among sexually active MSM by 60% averted 4.7% of HIV infections over a 10-year period (interquartile range (IQR): 2.3, 7.3). More HIV infections were averted when screening was focused on MSM with multiple recent sex partners: 60% coverage among MSM with multiple recent sex partners averted 9.8% of HIV infections (IQR: 8.1, 11.6). Increased STI screening among MSM without HIV averted more new HIV infections compared to the transmissions averted due to screening MSM with HIV, but fewer NG/CT tests were needed among MSM with HIV to avert a single new HIV infection. 

<b>Conclusions </b>

NG/CT screening among MSM is expected to lead to modest but clinically relevant reductions in HIV incidence among MSM.
